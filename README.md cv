# My CV (my git and github journey)
Welcome to my github-hosted CV! This project contains my personal resume written in markdown and published using github pages.
This is my first hands-on experience using Git and Github. I learned how to do many things which will be listed below on my 
what I learnt session. I now have a live cv and I'm excited to keep building on it.
